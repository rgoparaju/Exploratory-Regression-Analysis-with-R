## Exploratory Regression Analysis with R
I acquired a data set about air quality from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to perform some simple regression using R. The data set is about different hourly air quality measures in an Italian city spanning over almost an entire year, that measured amounts of different trace particulates present in the air in a polluted area. The different materials include carbon monoxide(CO), Non Metanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC), Benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), Total Nitrogen Oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>).

My aim was to find any significant statistical correlations between any two substances, as well as any significance in the relation between the temperatures and
