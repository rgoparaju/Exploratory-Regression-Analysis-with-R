## Exploratory Regression Analysis with R
I acquired a data set about air quality from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to perform some simple regression using R. The data set is about different hourly air quality measures in an Italian city spanning over almost an entire year, that measured amounts of different trace particulates present in the air in a polluted area. The different materials include carbon monoxide(CO), Non Metanic Hydrocarbons (NMHC), Benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), Total Nitrogen Oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). The dataset also tracks measurements of Temperature (T), and Absolulte and Relative Humidities (AH and RH, respectively).

My aim was to find any significant statistical correlations between the local temperature and the other substances, as well as any significance in the relation between the humidities and temperature. That is, I wanted to discover if the cross-effects between the chemicals and humidity, and find some model that is able to accurately predict the the temperature given the conditions of the chemicals present, as well as the humidity readings.

I first started by loading the data into R, then cleaning up the missing values in the file. These missing values were marked with '-200' in the columns which were missing a value for that row. Once that was accomplished,
